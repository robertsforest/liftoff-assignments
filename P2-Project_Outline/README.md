# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project (working title 'Picatta') is a web application that allows users to upload, view, and manipulate images. The motivation for this project comes largely from Google's discontinued Picasa application, which my mom used heavily for organizing photos and making collages. Users will be able to create an account, upload photos to cloud storage, and make basic edits to those photos. 

There are many powerful photo-editing applications, but these are also very complicated. This application targets users who want basic functionality without being overwhelmed by tools and features they will never use. Users will only be able to see and edit photos that they uploaded themselves, since this is intended for a personal photo collection. Users can sort uploaded photos into collections, make duplicate copies of photos for editing, and delete photos they don't want to keep.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and login to the application.
Upload photos: Users will be able to select a file from their local computer and upload it to cloud storage.
Photo gallery: Users can browse through their uploaded photos. They can create folders and drag photos into folders to organize their collection. Users can delete unwanted photos.
Manipulate photos: Users can edit uploaded photos. They will be able to crop, rotate, and resize uploaded images. (Time permitting, I want to add a feature that Picasa had, to created abstract images by tesselating and transforming an original image.)

### Technologies
The core of the application will be the same as we learned in Unit 2:
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate

Also I intend to use:
React
Amazon S3 cloud storage

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to interact with file systems for image upload.
React -  to allow users to interact with their images in the frontend.
Amazon S3 - how to store and access content from cloud storage.
