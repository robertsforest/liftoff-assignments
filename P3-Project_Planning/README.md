## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

Include at least 3 wireframes here, adding images or files to your repository as necessary. Format them as a bulleted/unordered list with links to the files.

These first two are what I consider the Minimum Product: Login, Upload, and Viewing Images:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertsforest/liftoff-assignments/master/P3-Project_Planning/MVP%20Image%20List%20and%20Viewer.jpg

These two images show desired features such as thumbnail display, basic editing, and folder organization:
